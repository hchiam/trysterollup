# trysterollup

trysterollup is a WIP p2p game controller wrapper around trystero.

This project came from experimenting with [trystero](https://github.com/dmotz/trystero) to make games while [learning WebRTC](https://github.com/hchiam/learning-webrtc).

Just one of the things I'm learning. https://github.com/hchiam/learning
