Trysterollup is a WIP P2P game controller wrapper around Trystero to simplify setting up multiplayer web games.

This project came from experimenting with [trystero](https://github.com/dmotz/trystero) to make games while [learning WebRTC](https://github.com/hchiam/learning-webrtc).

Just one of the things I'm learning. https://github.com/hchiam/learning
