Trysterollup is a WIP p2p game controller wrapper around Trystero to simplify setting up multiplayer game demos.

This project came from experimenting with [trystero](https://github.com/dmotz/trystero) to make games while [learning WebRTC](https://github.com/hchiam/learning-webrtc).

Just one of the things I'm learning. https://github.com/hchiam/learning

Demo: https://hchiam-trysterollup-demo.surge.sh/?room=my_room

Documentation: [/demo/documentation.md](https://github.com/hchiam/trysterollup/blob/main/demo/documentation.md)
