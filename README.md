Trysterollup is an experiment in making it easier to build small multiplayer games - no server setup needed.

It's technically a convenience wrapper around Trystero for P2P, as well as the Gamepad API.

This project came from trying [dmotz/trystero](https://github.com/dmotz/trystero) to make games while [learning WebRTC](https://github.com/hchiam/learning-webrtc).

Just one of the things I'm learning. <https://github.com/hchiam/learning>

Demo: <https://hchiam-trysterollup-demo.surge.sh/?room=my_room>

Documentation: [trysterollup/demo/documentation.md](https://github.com/hchiam/trysterollup/blob/main/demo/documentation.md)

(Still a WIP.)
